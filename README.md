In this repository, I present my proposed solutions to all the exercises assigned throughout the course. 

These exercises are categorized as follows:

Fundamental Python Exercises: These exercises are named simply with the exercise number (e.g., "1.1.1," "2.1.1," etc.). 
They are designed to help you practice the Python programming language, enhancing your coding skills and proficiency.

Project-Based Exercises: These exercises are labeled with "ex" followed by the exercise number (e.g., "ex1," "ex2," etc.). 
They are part of the ongoing project you'll be working on throughout the course. These exercises contribute to the development of a comprehensive project, 
which can be transformed into a fun and familiar game known as "HANGMAN."

Feel free to explore this repository, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions.
